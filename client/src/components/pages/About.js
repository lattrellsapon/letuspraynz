          There is no doubt that this global pandemic has not only turned our
          world upside down but has threatened the stability of our own faith.
          But what we may have come to realise is that through this trial God
          has given us more opportunities to pray, whether it be on our own,
          with our families, or even virtually with our friends.

          There is so much noise around us that hinder us from hearing God’s
          voice. But this lockdown has silenced them, allowing us to hear Him so
          much more clearly. Although our usual avenues for spiritual
          nourishment have been taken away, may it not discourage us but instead
          awaken our spiritual hunger.

          We may have been on different journeys, but it has all led us to this
          point. It doesn’t matter if this lockdown has allowed us to thrive or
          caused us great struggle because God continues to call us to Him. So,
          brothers and sisters I urge you to answer His calling to seek Him even
          more fiercely. After lockdown the noise of the world will return so we
          have to stay vigilant, anchor ourselves in prayer and continue to seek
          God’s voice amidst all the distractions.
