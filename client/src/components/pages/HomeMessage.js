      <p>
        God our Father, We come to you in our need To ask your protection
        against the 2019 N-Corona Virus, That has claimed lives And has affected
        many. We pray for your grace For the people tasked with studying the
        nature and cause Of this virus and its disease And of stemming the tide
        of its transmission. Guide the hands and minds of medical experts That
        they may minister to the sick With competence and compassion, And of
        those governments and private agencies That must find cure and solution
        to this epidemic. We pray for those afflicted May they be restored to
        health soon. Grant us the grace To work for the good of all And to help
        those in need. Grant this through our Lord, Jesus Christ, your Son, Who
        lives and reigns with You, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever
        and ever. Amen
      </p>
